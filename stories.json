The multi-stage attack chain, which automatically quarantines trojanized installers, involves downloading ICO files with base64 data from GitHub and eventually leads to a 3rd stage infostealer DLL that is still under analysis. While the Mac installer remains unconfirmed as trojanized, ongoing investigations are also examining other potentially compromised applications, such as Chrome extensions. The threat actor behind the supply chain compromise, which started in February 2022, has used a code signing certificate to sign the trojanized binaries, but connections to existing threat clusters remain unclear. SentinelOne updated their IOCs on March 30th, 2023, with contributions from the research community and continues to monitor the situation for further developments. 3CX identified the vulnerability in the recent versions 18.12.407 and 18.12.416 for the desktop app. A new certificate for the app will also be produced.", "references": ["https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/smoothoperator-ongoing-campaign-trojanizes-3cx-software-in-software-supply-chain-attack/", "https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/03/30/supply-chain-attack-against-3cxdesktopapp", "https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/125r3uu/20230329_situational_awareness_crowdstrike/", "https://www.3cx.com/community/threads/crowdstrike-endpoint-security-detection-re-3cx-desktop-app.119934/page-2#post-558898", "https://www.3cx.com/community/threads/3cx-desktopapp-security-alert.119951/", "https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/elastic-users-protected-from-suddenicon-supply-chain-attack", "https://www.volexity.com/blog/2023/03/30/3cx-supply-chain-compromise-leads-to-iconic-incident/"], "tags": {"name": "3CX Supply Chain Attack", "analytic_story": "3CX Supply Chain Attack", "category": ["Adversary Tactics"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_enrichments": [], "mitre_attack_tactics": [], "datamodels": [], "kill_chain_phases": []}, "detection_names": [], "investigation_names": [], "baseline_names": [], "author_company": "Splunk", "author_name": "Michael Haag", "detections": []}, {"name": "IcedID", "author": "Teoderick Contreras, Splunk", "date": "2021-07-29", "version": 1, "id": "1d2cc747-63d7-49a9-abb8-93aa36305603", "description": "Leverage searches that allow you to detect and investigate unusual activities that might relate to the IcedID banking trojan, including looking for file writes associated with its payload, process injection, shellcode execution and data collection.", "narrative": "IcedId banking trojan campaigns targeting banks and other vertical sectors.This malware is known in Microsoft Windows OS targetting browser such as firefox and chrom to steal banking information.

Attackers will often spend quite a bit of time and effort moving laterally. Because lateral movement renders an attacker the most vulnerable to detection, it's an excellent focus for detection and investigation.\\\nIndications of lateral movement in an Active Directory network can include the abuse of system utilities (such as `psexec.exe`), unauthorized use of remote desktop services, `file/admin$` shares, WMI, PowerShell, Service Control Manager, the DCOM protocol, WinRM or the abuse of scheduled tasks. Organizations must be extra vigilant in detecting lateral movement techniques and look for suspicious activity in and around high-value strategic network assets, such as Active Directory, which are often considered the primary target or \"crown jewels\" to a persistent threat actor.\\\nAn adversary can use lateral movement for multiple purposes, including remote execution of tools, pivoting to additional systems, obtaining access to specific information or files, access to additional credentials, exfiltrating data, or delivering a secondary effect. Adversaries may use legitimate credentials alongside inherent network and operating-system functionality to remotely connect to other systems and remain under the radar of network defenders.\\\nIf there is evidence of lateral movement, it is imperative for analysts to collect evidence of the associated offending hosts. For example, an attacker might leverage host A to gain access to host B. From there, the attacker may try to move laterally to host C. In this example, the analyst should gather as much information as possible from all three hosts. \\\n It is also important to collect authentication logs for each host, to ensure that the offending accounts are well-documented.

The first, CVE-2023-29298, identified by Rapid7 in July 2023, pertains to an access control bypass in ColdFusion's security mechanisms. This flaw allows attackers to access protected ColdFusion Administrator endpoints simply by manipulating the URL path, specifically by inserting an additional forward slash.\\ Compounding the threat is the revelation that CVE-2023-29298 can be chained with CVE-2023-26360, another severe ColdFusion vulnerability. This latter vulnerability, which has seen active exploitation, permits unauthorized attackers to execute arbitrary code or read arbitrary files on the affected system. In practice, an attacker could exploit the access control bypass to access sensitive ColdFusion endpoints and subsequently exploit the arbitrary code execution vulnerability, broadening their control and access over the targeted system. \\ The consequences of these vulnerabilities are manifold. Attackers can potentially login to the ColdFusion Administrator with known credentials, bruteforce their way in, leak sensitive information, or exploit other vulnerabilities in the exposed CFM and CFC files. This combination of vulnerabilities significantly heightens the risk profile for organizations using the affected versions of Adobe ColdFusion. \\ Addressing the urgency, Adobe released fixes for these vulnerabilities in July 2023, urging organizations to update to ColdFusion 2023 GA build, ColdFusion 2021 Update 7, and ColdFusion 2018 Update 17. However, Rapid7's disclosure highlights a potential incomplete fix, suggesting that organizations should remain vigilant and proactive in their security measures. \\\nIn conclusion, the discovery of these vulnerabilities and their potential to be exploited in tandem presents a significant security challenge.

It can also help to understand whether the issue is restricted to a single user or system or is broader in scope.\\\nWhen looking at the target of the behavior illustrated by the event, you should note the sensitivity of the user and or/system to help determine the potential impact. It is also helpful to see what other events involving the target have occurred in the recent past. This can help tie different events together and give further situational awareness regarding the target.\\\nVarious types of information for external systems should be reviewed and (potentially) collected if the incident is, indeed, judged to be malicious. Information like this can be useful in generating your own threat intelligence to create alerts in the future.\\\nLooking at the country, responsible party, and fully qualified domain names associated with the external IP address--as well as the registration information associated with those domain names, if they are frequently visited by others--can help you answer the question of \"who,\" in regard to the external system. Answering that can help qualify the event and may serve useful for tracking. In addition, there are various sources that can provide some reputation information on the IP address or domain name, which can assist in determining if the event is malicious in nature. Finally, determining whether or not there are other events associated with the IP address may help connect some dots or show other events that should be brought into scope.\\\nGathering various data elements on the system of interest can sometimes help quickly determine that something suspicious may be happening. Some of these items include determining who else may have recently logged into the system, whether any unusual scheduled tasks exist, whether the system is communicating on suspicious ports, whether there are modifications to sensitive registry keys, and whether there are any known vulnerabilities on the system. This information can often highlight other activity commonly seen in attack scenarios or give more information about how the system may have been targeted.\\\nhen a specific service or application is targeted, it is often helpful to know the associated version to help determine whether or not it is vulnerable to a specific exploit.\\\nhen it is suspected there is an attack targeting a web server, it is helpful to look at some of the behavior of the web service to see if there is evidence that the service has been compromised. Some indications of this might be network connections to external resources, the web service spawning child processes that are not associated with typical behavior, and whether the service wrote any files that might be malicious in nature.\\\nIn the event that a suspicious file is found, we can review more information about it to help determine if it is, in fact, malicious. Identifying the file type, any processes that have the file open, what processes created and/or modified the file, and the number of systems that may have this file can help to determine if the file is malicious. Also, determining the file hash and checking it against reputation sources, such as VirusTotal, can sometimes quickly help determine whether it is malicious in nature.\\\nOften, a simple inspection of a suspect process name and path can tell you if the system has been compromised. For example, if `svchost.exe` is found running from a location other than `C:\\Windows\\System32`, it is likely something malicious designed to hide in plain sight when simply reviewing process names. Similarly, if the process itself seems legitimate, but the parent process is running from the temporary browser cache, there may be activity initiated via a compromised website the user visited.\\\nIt can also be very helpful to examine various behaviors of the process of interest or the parent of the process that is of interest. For example, if it turns out that the process of interest is malicious, it would be good to see if the parent to that process spawned other processes that might also be worth further scrutiny. If a process is suspect, reviewing the network connections made around the time of the event and/or if the process spawned any child processes could be helpful in determining whether it is malicious or executing a malicious script.", "references": ["https://github.com/SpiderLabs/owasp-modsecurity-crs/blob/v3.2/dev/rules/REQUEST-944-APPLICATION-ATTACK-JAVA.conf"], "tags": {"name": "Apache Struts Vulnerability", "analytic_story": "Apache Struts Vulnerability", "category": ["Vulnerability"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_enrichments": [], "mitre_attack_tactics": [], "datamodels": [], "kill_chain_phases": []}, "detection_names": [], "investigation_names": ["ESCU - Get Notable History - Response Task", "ESCU - Investigate Suspicious Strings in HTTP Header - Response Task", "ESCU - Investigate Web POSTs From src - Response Task"], "baseline_names": [], "author_company": "Splunk", "author_name": "Rico Valdez", "detections": []}, {"name": "APT29 Diplomatic Deceptions with WINELOADER", "author": "Michael Haag, splunk", "date": "2024-03-26", "version": 1, "id": "7cb5fdb5-4c36-4721-8b0a-4cc5e78afadd", "description": "APT29, a sophisticated threat actor linked to the Russian SVR, has expanded its cyber espionage activities to target European diplomats and German political parties.

In June 2023, threat actors utilized this vulnerability to implant a webshell on a NetScaler ADC appliance within a critical infrastructure organization's non-production environment. This action granted them the ability to perform active directory discovery, data collection, and exfiltration. Notably, attempts for lateral movement to a domain controller were obstructed by network-segmentation controls. \\\nThe compromised organization reported the breach, leading Citrix to issue a patch on July 18, 2023. Multiple advisories have since outlined the threat actors' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including their initial access, persistence, privilege escalation, defense evasion, credential access, discovery, collection, command and control, and impact. These advisories also provide detection methods and recommend incident response measures. \\\nThe threat actors executed several activities during their attack, such as uploading a TGZ file with a generic webshell, discovery script, and setuid binary on the ADC appliance; conducting SMB scanning on the subnet; using the webshell for active directory enumeration and data exfiltration; and accessing NetScaler configuration files and decryption keys. They also decrypted an active directory credential, queried the active directory for various information, encrypted collected data, exfiltrated it as an image file, and attempted to erase their artifacts. Despite these actions, further discovery and lateral movement were impeded due to the organization's network-segmentation controls. \\\nAdvisories suggest conducting specific checks on the ADC shell interface to detect signs of compromise. If a compromise is detected, organizations should isolate potentially affected hosts, reimage compromised hosts, provide new account credentials, collect and review artifacts, and report the compromise. To mitigate the threat, organizations are advised to promptly install the relevant updates for NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway, adhere to cybersecurity best practices, and apply robust network-segmentation controls on NetScaler appliances and other internet-facing devices. \\", "references": ["https://attackerkb.com/topics/si09VNJhHh/cve-2023-3519", "https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-07/aa23-201a_csa_threat_actors_exploiting_citrix-cve-2023-3519_to_implant_webshells.pdf", "https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX561482/citrix-adc-and-citrix-gateway-security-bulletin-for-cve20233519-cve20233466-cve20233467"], "tags": {"name": "Citrix Netscaler ADC CVE-2023-3519", "analytic_story": "Citrix Netscaler ADC CVE-2023-3519", "category": ["Adversary Tactics"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_enrichments": [], "mitre_attack_tactics": [], "datamodels": [], "kill_chain_phases": []}, "detection_names": [], "investigation_names": [], "baseline_names": [], "author_company": "Splunk", "author_name": "Michael Haag", "detections": []}, {"name": "Citrix ShareFile RCE CVE-2023-24489", "author": "Michael Haag, Splunk", "date": "2023-07-26", "version": 1, "id": "10c7e01a-5743-4995-99df-a66f6b5db653", "description": "A critical vulnerability has been discovered in ShareFile's Storage Zones Controller software (CVE-2023-24489), used by numerous organizations for file sharing and storage.

It is a zero-day flaw, meaning it was already being exploited before Microsoft became aware of it or had a chance to develop a patch. \\\nAn attacker exploiting this vulnerability would create a Microsoft Office document containing malicious code. This document, when opened by the victim, allows for remote code execution, giving the attacker the ability to run their own code on the victim's machine. This poses a significant risk as the attacker could perform actions like data theft, system damage, or creating backdoors for future access. \\\nCurrently, there is no security patch available from Microsoft, which makes the issue more critical. Microsoft is working on investigating these vulnerabilities and will likely provide a security update either through their monthly release cycle or an out-of-cycle update, based on the urgency. \\\nIn the meantime, users of Microsoft Defender for Office and those utilizing the \"Block all Office applications from creating child processes\" Attack Surface Reduction Rule are protected from attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

An initial false link to Emotet stirred the security community, but deeper analysis confirmed its true identity as DarkGate, with characteristics like AutoIt scripts and a known command-and-control protocol. This report by Fabian Marquardt details the intricate infection mechanisms, including MSI and VBS file deliveries, sophisticated evasion techniques, and a robust configuration extraction method surpassing current standards. The single developer behind DarkGate, active on cybercrime forums, has shifted the malware's use from private to a rent-out model, implying an expected rise in its deployment.

The campaign smartly manipulates stolen email conversations, embedding hyperlinks that, once clicked, activate a malware download. Fabian Marquardt's analysis traces the infection's footprint, revealing a dual delivery mechanism through MSI and VBS files. These files, cloaked in legitimate wrappers or obscured with junk code, ultimately download the malware via embedded scripts. \\\nMarquardt delves into the AutoIt script-based infection, uncovering the calculated use of compiled scripts and base64-encoded data to disguise the execution of malicious shellcode. The subsequent stages of infection exhibit the malware's capability to evade detection, leveraging memory allocation techniques to bypass security measures. Marquardt also explores the loader's function, which decrypts further malicious payloads by interacting with the script's encoded components. \\\nThe analytical narrative captures a cross-section of the cybersecurity landscape, reflecting the shift in DarkGate's operational strategy from exclusive use by the developer to a broader dissemination through a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) model. This transition suggests an anticipated escalation in DarkGate-related attacks. \\\nSignificantly, the report contributes to cybersecurity defenses by outlining a more effective method for extracting malware configurations, providing the community with the means to anticipate and mitigate the evolving threats posed by this pernicious malware.

Attackers will often spend quite a bit of time and effort moving laterally. Because lateral movement renders an attacker the most vulnerable to detection, it's an excellent focus for detection and investigation. Indications of lateral movement can include the abuse of system utilities (such as `psexec.exe`), unauthorized use of remote desktop services, `file/admin$` shares, WMI, PowerShell, pass-the-hash, or the abuse of scheduled tasks. Organizations must be extra vigilant in detecting lateral movement techniques and look for suspicious activity in and around high-value strategic network assets, such as Active Directory, which are often considered the primary target or \"crown jewels\" to a persistent threat actor. An adversary can use lateral movement for multiple purposes, including remote execution of tools, pivoting to additional systems, obtaining access to specific information or files, access to additional credentials, exfiltrating data, or delivering a secondary effect. Adversaries may use legitimate credentials alongside inherent network and operating-system functionality to remotely connect to other systems and remain under the radar of network defenders. If there is evidence of lateral movement, it is imperative for analysts to collect evidence of the associated offending hosts. For example, an attacker might leverage host A to gain access to host B. From there, the attacker may try to move laterally to host C. In this example, the analyst should gather as much information as possible from all three hosts. It is also important to collect authentication logs for each host, to ensure that the offending accounts are well-documented.

A large volume of this traffic can result in a DOS on the victim's machine. This misconfiguration leads to two possible victims, the first being the DNS servers participating in an attack and the other being the hosts that are the targets of the DOS attack.\\\nThe search in this story can help you to detect if attackers are abusing your company's DNS infrastructure to launch DNS amplification attacks causing Denial of Service to other victims.", "references": ["https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A", "https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/dns-amplification/"], "tags": {"name": "DNS Amplification Attacks", "analytic_story": "DNS Amplification Attacks", "category": ["Abuse"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Security Monitoring", "mitre_attack_enrichments": [], "mitre_attack_tactics": [], "datamodels": [], "kill_chain_phases": []}, "detection_names": [], "investigation_names": ["ESCU - Get Notable History - Response Task"], "baseline_names": [], "author_company": "Splunk", "author_name": "Bhavin Patel", "detections": []}, {"name": "DNS Hijacking", "author": "Bhavin Patel, Splunk", "date": "2020-02-04", "version": 1, "id": "8169f17b-ef68-4b59-aa28-586907301221", "description": "Secure your environment against DNS hijacks with searches that help you detect and investigate unauthorized changes to DNS records.", "narrative": "Dubbed the Achilles heel of the Internet (see https://www.f5.com/labs/articles/threat-intelligence/dns-is-still-the-achilles-heel-of-the-internet-25613), DNS plays a critical role in routing web traffic but is notoriously vulnerable to attack. One reason is its distributed nature. It relies on unstructured connections between millions of clients and servers over inherently insecure protocols.\\\nThe gravity and extent of the importance of securing DNS from attacks is undeniable. The fallout of compromised DNS can be disastrous. Not only can hackers bring down an entire business, they can intercept confidential information, emails, and login credentials, as well. \\\nOn January 22, 2019, the US Department of Homeland Security 2019's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) raised awareness of some high-profile DNS hijacking attacks against infrastructure, both in the United States and abroad. It issued Emergency Directive 19-01 (see https://cyber.dhs.gov/ed/19-01/), which summarized the activity and required government agencies to take the following four actions, all within 10 days: \\\n1. For all .gov or other agency-managed domains, audit public DNS records on all authoritative and secondary DNS servers, verify that they resolve to the intended location or report them to CISA.\\\n1. Update the passwords for all accounts on systems that can make changes to each agency 2019's DNS records.\\\n1. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all accounts on systems that can make changes to each agency's 2019 DNS records or, if impossible, provide CISA with the names of systems, the reasons why MFA cannot be enabled within the required timeline, and an ETA for when it can be enabled.\\\n1. CISA will begin regular delivery of newly added certificates to Certificate Transparency (CT) logs for agency domains via the Cyber Hygiene service. Upon receipt, agencies must immediately begin monitoring CT log data for certificates issued that they did not request. If an agency confirms that a certificate was unauthorized, it must report the certificate to the issuing certificate authority and to CISA. Of course, it makes sense to put equivalent actions in place within your environment, as well. \\\nIn DNS hijacking, the attacker assumes control over an account or makes use of a DNS service exploit to make changes to DNS records. Once they gain access, attackers can substitute their own MX records, name-server records, and addresses, redirecting emails and traffic through their infrastructure, where they can read, copy, or modify information seen. They can also generate valid encryption certificates to help them avoid browser-certificate checks. In one notable attack on the Internet service provider, GoDaddy, the hackers altered Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records a relatively minor change that did not inflict excessive damage but allowed for more effective spam campaigns.\\\nThe searches in this Analytic Story help you detect and investigate activities that may indicate that DNS hijacking has taken place within your environment.", "references": ["https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/09/apt33-insights-into-iranian-cyber-espionage.html", "https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/2013/04/15/on-the-trail-of-malicious-dynamic-dns-domains/", "http://www.noip.com/blog/2014/07/11/dynamic-dns-can-use-2/", "https://www.splunk.com/blog/2015/08/04/detecting-dynamic-dns-domains-in-splunk.html"], "tags": {"name": "DNS Hijacking", "analytic_story": "DNS Hijacking", "category": ["Adversary Tactics"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_enrichments": [], "mitre_attack_tactics": [], "datamodels": [], "kill_chain_phases": []}, "detection_names": [], "investigation_names": ["ESCU - Get DNS Server History for a host - Response Task"], "baseline_names": ["ESCU - Discover DNS records"], "author_company": "Splunk", "author_name": "Bhavin Patel", "detections": []}, {"name": "sAMAccountName Spoofing and Domain Controller Impersonation", "author": "Mauricio Velazco, Splunk", "date": "2021-12-20", "version": 1, "id": "0244fdee-61be-11ec-900e-acde48001122", "description": "Monitor for activities and techniques associated with the exploitation of the sAMAccountName Spoofing (CVE-2021-42278) and Domain Controller Impersonation (CVE-2021-42287) vulnerabilities.", "narrative": "On November 9, 2021, Microsoft released patches to address two vulnerabilities that affect Windows Active Directory networks, sAMAccountName Spoofing (CVE-2021-42278) and Domain Controller Impersonation (CVE-2021-42287).

Meanwhile, CVE-2023-35081 lets authenticated administrators remotely write arbitrary files to the server. Both vulnerabilities have been exploited in targeted attacks against government ministries and could be used in conjunction. With the presence of PoC code for CVE-2023-35078, the risk of broader exploitation has increased. While initially leveraged in limited attacks, the exploitation is expected to rise, possibly involving state-sponsored actors. Organizations are urged to apply immediate patches and conduct regular system assessments to ensure security.", "narrative": "Ivantis Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) product, formerly known as MobileIron Core and extensively utilized by IT teams to manage mobile devices, applications, and content, has been found to harbor several critical vulnerabilities. Specifically, CVE-2023-35078 allows remote unauthenticated attackers to access sensitive data and make changes to servers. This flaw has been leveraged in targeted attacks against Norwegian government ministries. In addition, CVE-2023-35081 permits an authenticated attacker with administrative privileges to remotely write arbitrary files to the server. \\\nRecently, attention has shifted to CVE-2023-35082, which was initially believed to affect only MobileIron Core 11.2 and below. Subsequent investigations revealed its wider influence, affecting EPMM versions 11.10, 11.9, 11.8, and MobileIron Core 11.7 and earlier. This vulnerability facilitates unauthorized access to the API via the URI path /mifs/asfV3/api/v2/. \\\nWhen combined, these vulnerabilities can be exploited to bypass administrative authentication and access control list (ACL) restrictions, leading to malicious file writing and potential OS command execution. Both have been actively exploited, possibly by state-sponsored actors, prompting urgent advisories from Ivanti and Rapid7, alongside CISA. Given the thousands of potentially vulnerable internet-exposed systems and the presence of PoC code for CVE-2023-35078, the risk of extensive exploitation escalates. The situation is further muddled by Ivanti's 2020 acquisition of MobileIron, which had its known issues. Collectively, these vulnerabilities present a significant risk to organizations utilizing Ivanti's EPMM, emphasizing the need for swift patching, vigilant monitoring, and timely application of fixes to counteract potential threats.", "references": ["https://www.securityweek.com/second-ivanti-epmm-zero-day-vulnerability-exploited-in-targeted-attacks/", "https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/07/28/ivanti-releases-security-updates-epmm-address-cve-2023-35081", "https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-35078", "https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/CVE-2023-35078-Remote-unauthenticated-API-access-vulnerability?language=en_US"], "tags": {"name": "Ivanti EPMM Remote Unauthenticated Access", "analytic_story": "Ivanti EPMM Remote Unauthenticated Access", "category": ["Vulnerability", "Adversary Tactics"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_enrichments": [], "mitre_attack_tactics": [], "datamodels": [], "kill_chain_phases": []}, "detection_names": [], "investigation_names": [], "baseline_names": [], "author_company": "Splunk", "author_name": "Michael Haag", "detections": []}, {"name": "Ivanti Sentry Authentication Bypass CVE-2023-38035", "author": "Michael Haag, Splunk", "date": "2023-08-24", "version": 1, "id": "da229be2-4637-47a5-b551-1d4b64f411c6", "description": "A critical vulnerability, designated as CVE-2023-38035, has been identified in Ivanti Sentry (formerly MobileIron Sentry). It affects all supported versions, including 9.18, 9.17, and 9.16, as well as older versions. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to access the System Manager Portal (typically hosted on port 8443) and make configuration changes, potentially executing OS commands as root. However, the risk is low for users who haven't exposed port 8443 online. This flaw is distinct from other Ivanti products. It's imperative for organizations to check for unrecognized HTTP requests to /services/* as a potential indicator of compromise.", "narrative": "CVE-2023-38035 presents a significant security risk in the Ivanti Sentry administration interface. The vulnerability was identified shortly after another notable vulnerability in Ivanti EPMM (CVE-2023-35078) was discovered being exploited in the wild. The current vulnerability allows a malicious actor, without requiring authentication, to access the System Manager Portal, typically hosted on port 8443. Upon successful exploitation, the attacker can make configuration alterations to both the Sentry system and its underlying OS. The potential damage is significant, enabling the attacker to execute commands on the system with root privileges. \\\nWhile this vulnerability scored high on the CVSS scale, its risk is relatively mitigated for clients who have not exposed port 8443 to the internet. The primary exploitation vector is the System Manager Portal, an administrative interface for Sentry. \\\nAs of now, definitive indicators of compromise (IoCs) are elusive. However, any unexpected HTTP requests to the endpoint /services/* could be a red flag. It's worth noting that the exploited endpoint might not be the sole vulnerable point, suggesting other potential gateways for attackers. Ivanti Sentry's system doesn't provide a typical Unix shell, but in the event of a known system breach, the /var/log/tomcat2/ directory contains access logs that may reveal accessed endpoints.

These searches help detect evidence of these attacks, such as network connections to external resources or web services spawning atypical child processes, among others.", "narrative": "This Analytic Story looks for probing and exploitation attempts targeting JBoss application servers. While the vulnerabilities associated with this story are rather dated, they were leveraged in a spring 2016 campaign in connection with the Samsam ransomware variant. Incidents involving this ransomware are unique, in that they begin with attacks against vulnerable services, rather than the phishing or drive-by attacks more common with ransomware. In this case, vulnerable JBoss applications appear to be the target of choice.\\\nIt is helpful to understand how often a notable event generated by this story occurs, as well as the commonalities between some of these events, both of which may provide clues about whether this is a common occurrence of minimal concern or a rare event that may require more extensive investigation. It may also help to understand whether the issue is restricted to a single user/system or whether it is broader in scope.\\\nWhen looking at the target of the behavior uncovered by the event, you should note the sensitivity of the user and or/system to help determine the potential impact. It is also helpful to identify other recent events involving the target. This can help tie different events together and give further situational awareness regarding the target host.\\\nVarious types of information for external systems should be reviewed and, potentially, collected if the incident is, indeed, judged to be malicious. This data may be useful for generating your own threat intelligence, so you can create future alerts.\\\nThe following factors may assist you in determining whether the event is malicious: \\\n1. Country of origin\\\n1. Responsible party\\\n1. Fully qualified domain names associated with the external IP address\\\n1. Registration of fully qualified domain names associated with external IP address Determining whether it is a dynamic domain frequently visited by others and/or how third parties categorize it can also help you qualify and understand the event and possible motivation for the attack. In addition, there are various sources that may provide reputation information on the IP address or domain name, which can assist you in determining whether the event is malicious in nature. Finally, determining whether there are other events associated with the IP address may help connect data points or expose other historic events that might be brought back into scope.\\\nGathering various data on the system of interest can sometimes help quickly determine whether something suspicious is happening. Some of these items include determining who else may have logged into the system recently, whether any unusual scheduled tasks exist, whether the system is communicating on suspicious ports, whether there are modifications to sensitive registry keys, and/or whether there are any known vulnerabilities on the system. This information can often highlight other activity commonly seen in attack scenarios or give more information about how the system may have been targeted.\\\nhen a specific service or application is targeted, it is often helpful to know the associated version, to help determine whether it is vulnerable to a specific exploit.\\\nIf you suspect an attack targeting a web server, it is helpful to look at some of the behavior of the web service to see if there is evidence that the service has been compromised. Some indications of this might be network connections to external resources, the web service spawning child processes that are not associated with typical behavior, and whether the service wrote any files that might be malicious in nature.\\\nIf a suspicious file is found, we can review more information about it to help determine if it is, in fact, malicious. Identifying the file type, any processes that opened the file, the processes that may have created and/or modified the file, and how many other systems potentially have this file can you determine whether the file is malicious. Also, determining the file hash and checking it against reputation sources, such as VirusTotal, can sometimes help you quickly determine if it is malicious in nature.\\\nOften, a simple inspection of a suspect process name and path can tell you if the system has been compromised. For example, if svchost.exe is found running from a location other than `C:\\Windows\\System32`, it is likely something malicious designed to hide in plain sight when simply reviewing process names. \\\nIt can also be helpful to examine various behaviors of and the parent of the process of interest. For example, if it turns out the process of interest is malicious, it would be good to see whether the parent process spawned other processes that might also warrant further scrutiny. If a process is suspect, a review of the network connections made around the time of the event and noting whether the process has spawned any child processes could be helpful in determining whether it is malicious or executing a malicious script.", "references": ["http://www.deependresearch.org/2016/04/jboss-exploits-view-from-victim.html"], "tags": {"name": "JBoss Vulnerability", "analytic_story": "JBoss Vulnerability", "category": ["Vulnerability"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_enrichments": [], "mitre_attack_tactics": [], "datamodels": [], "kill_chain_phases": []}, "detection_names": [], "investigation_names": ["ESCU - Get Notable History - Response Task"], "baseline_names": [], "author_company": "Splunk", "author_name": "Bhavin Patel", "detections": []}, {"name": "Jenkins Server Vulnerabilities", "author": "Michael Haag, Splunk", "date": "2024-01-29", "version": 1, "id": "789e76e6-4b5e-4af3-ab8c-46578d84ccff", "description": "This analytic story provides a comprehensive view of Jenkins server vulnerabilities and associated detection analytics.", "narrative": "The following analytic story provides a comprehensive view of Jenkins server vulnerabilities and associated detection analytics.

It is helpful to understand how often the notable events generated by this story occur, as well as the commonalities between some of these events. These factors may provide clues about whether this is a common occurrence of minimal concern or a rare event that may require more extensive investigation. Likewise, it is important to determine whether the issue is restricted to a single user/system or is broader in scope. \\\nThe following factors may assist you in determining whether the event is malicious: \\\n1. Country of origin \\\n1. Responsible party \\\n1. Fully qualified domain names associated with the external IP address \\\n1. Registration of fully qualified domain names associated with external IP address \\\nDetermining whether it is a dynamic domain frequently visited by others and/or how third parties categorize it can also help you answer some questions surrounding the attacker and details related to the external system. In addition, there are various sources--such as VirusTotal&#151; that can provide some reputation information on the IP address or domain name, which can assist in determining whether the event is malicious. Finally, determining whether there are other events associated with the IP address may help connect data points or show other events that should be brought into scope. \\\nGathering data on the system of interest can sometimes help you quickly determine whether something suspicious is happening. Some of these items include finding out who else may have recently logged into the system, whether any unusual scheduled tasks exist, whether the system is communicating on suspicious ports, whether there are modifications to sensitive registry keys, and whether there are any known vulnerabilities on the system. This information can often highlight other activity commonly seen in attack scenarios or give more information about how the system may have been targeted. \\\nOften, a simple inspection of the process name and path can tell you if the system has been compromised. For example, if `svchost.exe` is found running from a location other than `C:\\Windows\\System32`, it is likely something malicious designed to hide in plain sight when cursorily reviewing process names. Similarly, if the process itself seems legitimate, but the parent process is running from the temporary browser cache, that could be indicative of activity initiated via a compromised website a user visited. \\\nIt can also be very helpful to examine various behaviors of the process of interest or the parent of the process of interest. For example, if it turns out the process of interest is malicious, it would be good to see if the parent to that process spawned other processes that might be worth further scrutiny. If a process is suspect, a review of the network connections made in and around the time of the event and/or whether the process spawned any child processes could be helpful, as well. \\\nIn the event a system is suspected of having been compromised via a malicious website, we suggest reviewing the browsing activity from that system around the time of the event. If categories are given for the URLs visited, that can help you zero in on possible malicious sites. \\\nMost recently we have added new content related to PowerShell Script Block logging, Windows EventCode 4104. Script block logging presents the deobfuscated and raw script executed on an endpoint. The analytics produced were tested against commonly used attack frameworks - PowerShell-Empire, Cobalt Strike and Covenant. In addition, we sampled publicly available samples that utilize PowerShell and validated coverage. The analytics are here to identify suspicious usage, cmdlets, or script values. 4104 events are enabled via the Windows registry and may generate a large volume of data if enabled globally. Enabling on critical systems or a limited set may be best. During triage of 4104 events, review parallel processes for other processes and command executed. Identify any file modifications and network communication and review accordingly. Fortunately, we get the full script to determine the level of threat identified.", "references": ["https://blogs.mcafee.com/mcafee-labs/malware-employs-powershell-to-infect-systems/", "https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/"], "tags": {"name": "Malicious PowerShell", "analytic_story": "Malicious PowerShell", "category": ["Adversary Tactics"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_enrichments": [], "mitre_attack_tactics": [], "datamodels": [], "kill_chain_phases": []}, "detection_names": [], "investigation_names": ["ESCU - Get History Of Email Sources - Response Task", "ESCU - Get Notable History - Response Task", "ESCU - Get Parent Process Info - Response Task", "ESCU - Get Process Info - Response Task"], "baseline_names": [], "author_company": "Splunk", "author_name": "David Dorsey", "detections": []}, {"name": "Masquerading - Rename System Utilities", "author": "Michael Haag, Splunk", "date": "2021-04-26", "version": 1, "id": "f0258af4-a6ae-11eb-b3c2-acde48001122", "description": "Adversaries may rename legitimate system utilities to try to evade security mechanisms concerning the usage of those utilities.", "narrative": "Security monitoring and control mechanisms may be in place for system utilities adversaries are capable of abusing.

Moore for use as a Perl-based portable network tool, with assistance from core developer Matt Miller.

Rapid7 has also developed two proprietary OpenCore tools, Metasploit Pro, Metasploit Express.\\\nThis framework has become the go-to exploit development and mitigation tool. Prior to Metasploit, pen testers had to perform all probes manually by using a variety of tools that may or may not have supported the platform they were testing, writing their own code by hand, and introducing it onto networks manually.

This software, developed by Progress Software Corporation, a US-based company and its subsidiary Ipswitch, is a managed file transfer solution. It is used by thousands of organizations worldwide, including Chase, Disney, GEICO, and MLB, and by 3.5 million developers. The software allows for secure file transfers between business partners and customers using SFTP, SCP, and HTTP-based uploads.\\\nThe zero-day vulnerability has been exploited to steal data on a large scale from various organizations. The identity of the threat actors and the exact timeline of the exploitation remains unclear. However, it has been confirmed that multiple organizations have experienced breaches and data theft.\\\nIn response to this critical situation, Progress released a security advisory warning customers of the vulnerability and providing mitigation strategies while a patch has been released. They urged customers to take immediate action to protect their MOVEit environments. They suggested blocking external traffic to ports 80 and 445 on the MOVEit server and checking the c:\\MOVEitTransfer\\wwwroot\\ folder for unexpected files, including backups or large file downloads.\\\nBlocking these ports will prevent external access to the web UI, prevent some MOVEit Automation tasks from working, block APIs, and prevent the Outlook MOVEit plugin from working. However, SFTP and FTP/s protocols can continue to be used for file transfers.\\\nThere is currently no detailed information about the zero-day vulnerability. But based on the ports blocked and the specific location to check for unusual files, the flaw is likely a web-facing vulnerability.\\\nWhile Progress has officially confirmed that the vulnerability is being actively exploited, it is clear from several reports that multiple organizations have already had data stolen using this zero-day vulnerability. The exploitation appears very similar to the mass exploitation of a GoAnywhere MFT zero-day in January 2023 and the December 2020 zero-day exploitation of Accellion FTA servers.

Discovered by NetSPI in 2023, this vulnerability capitalizes on the unchanged syncing capability of form objects, despite previous patches aimed at securing script code in custom forms. This technical blog delves into the discovery and weaponization of CVE-2024-21378, enhancing the Outlook penetration testing tool, Ruler, to exploit this flaw. A forthcoming pull request will provide a proof-of-concept code, aiding organizations in mitigating this security risk.", "narrative": "CVE-2024-21378 is a weakness in Microsoft Outlook that lets hackers execute code remotely if they can authenticate themselves. Researchers at NetSPI found this issue in 2023. The problem started with a technique from 2017 by Etienne Stalmans at SensePost, who found a way to run code using VBScript in Outlook forms. Microsoft tried to fix it by only allowing approved script code in custom forms, but they didn't fix the main issue, which is how these forms sync. To exploit this vulnerability, you need to know how Outlook forms sync, using something called MAPI, and how they use certain properties and attachments when they're set up for the first time. Hackers can mess with these properties and attachments to run their own code. They do this by tricking the form's setup process, changing registry keys and files to get past Outlook's security. To show how this could be done, researchers modified Ruler, a tool for testing Outlook's security. They changed it so it could sync a harmful form with the right properties to run a specific type of file, a COM compliant native DLL. This not only showed that CVE-2024-21378 could be exploited but also that it could affect a lot of companies since so many use Microsoft Outlook. The discovery and the way it was exploited remind us that we always need to be on the lookout for security risks and work hard to protect against them. The cybersecurity world is always watching for the next big threat that could put our digital world at risk. As companies rush to fix this issue, it's a reminder of how important it is to stay ahead of these threats.", "references": ["https://www.netspi.com/blog/technical/red-team-operations/microsoft-outlook-remote-code-execution-cve-2024-21378/"], "tags": {"name": "Outlook RCE CVE-2024-21378", "analytic_story": "Outlook RCE CVE-2024-21378", "category": ["Adversary Tactics"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_enrichments": [], "mitre_attack_tactics": [], "datamodels": [], "kill_chain_phases": []}, "detection_names": [], "investigation_names": [], "baseline_names": [], "author_company": "Teoderick Contreras, Splunk", "author_name": "Michael Haag", "detections": []}, {"name": "PaperCut MF NG Vulnerability", "author": "Michael Haag, Splunk", "date": "2023-05-15", "version": 1, "id": "2493d270-5665-4fb4-99c7-8f886f260676", "description": "The FBI has issued a joint advisory concerning the exploitation of a PaperCut MF/NG vulnerability (CVE-2023-27350) by malicious actors, which began in mid-April 2023 and has been ongoing.

Samas or SamsamCrypt) was launched in 2015 by a group of Iranian threat actors. The malicious software has affected and continues to affect thousands of victims and has raised almost $6M in ransom.\\\nAlthough categorized under the heading of ransomware, SamSam campaigns have some importance distinguishing characteristics. Most notable is the fact that conventional ransomware is a numbers game. Perpetrators use a \"spray-and-pray\" approach with phishing campaigns or other mechanisms, charging a small ransom (typically under $1,000). The goal is to find a large number of victims willing to pay these mini-ransoms, adding up to a lucrative payday. They use relatively simple methods for infecting systems.\\\nSamSam attacks are different beasts. They have become progressively more targeted and skillful than typical ransomware attacks. First, malicious actors break into a victim's network, surveil it, then run the malware manually. The attacks are tailored to cause maximum damage and the threat actors usually demand amounts in the tens of thousands of dollars.\\\nIn a typical attack on one large healthcare organization in 2018, the company ended up paying a ransom of four Bitcoins, then worth $56,707. Reports showed that access to the company's files was restored within two hours of paying the sum.\\\nAccording to Sophos, SamSam previously leveraged  RDP to gain access to targeted networks via brute force. SamSam is not spread automatically, like other malware. It requires skill because it forces the attacker to adapt their tactics to the individual environment. Next, the actors escalate their privileges to admin level. They scan the networks for worthy targets, using conventional tools, such as PsExec or PaExec, to deploy/execute, quickly encrypting files.\\\nThis Analytic Story includes searches designed to help detect and investigate signs of the SamSam ransomware, such as the creation of fileswrites to system32, writes with tell-tale extensions, batch files written to system32, and evidence of brute-force attacks via RDP.", "references": ["https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/an-in-depth-analysis-of-samsam-ransomware-and-boss-spider/", "https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2018/07/31/samsam-the-almost-6-million-ransomware/", "https://thehackernews.com/2018/07/samsam-ransomware-attacks.html"], "tags": {"name": "SamSam Ransomware", "analytic_story": "SamSam Ransomware", "category": ["Malware"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_enrichments": [], "mitre_attack_tactics": [], "datamodels": [], "kill_chain_phases": []}, "detection_names": [], "investigation_names": ["ESCU - Get Backup Logs For Endpoint - Response Task", "ESCU - Get History Of Email Sources - Response Task", "ESCU - Get Notable History - Response Task", "ESCU - Get Parent Process Info - Response Task", "ESCU - Get Process Info - Response Task", "ESCU - Get Process Information For Port Activity - Response Task", "ESCU - Investigate Successful Remote Desktop Authentications - Response Task"], "baseline_names": ["ESCU - Add Prohibited Processes to Enterprise Security", "ESCU - Identify Systems Creating Remote Desktop Traffic", "ESCU - Identify Systems Receiving Remote Desktop Traffic", "ESCU - Identify Systems Using Remote Desktop"], "author_company": "Splunk", "author_name": "Rico Valdez", "detections": []}, {"name": "RedLine Stealer", "author": "Teoderick Contreras, Splunk", "date": "2023-04-24", "version": 1, "id": "12e31e8b-671b-4d6e-b362-a682812a71eb", "description": "Leverage searches that allow you to detect and investigate unusual activities that might relate to the Redline Stealer trojan, including looking for file writes associated with its payload, screencapture, registry modification, persistence and data collection..", "narrative": "RedLine Stealer is a malware available on underground forum and subscription basis that are compiled or written in C#.

Scheduling tasks can be beneficial for an attacker as it can allow them to execute actions at times when the system is less likely to be monitored actively. Different operating systems have different utilities for task scheduling, for example, Unix-like systems have Cron, while Windows has Scheduled Tasks and At Jobs.", "narrative": "MITRE ATT&CK technique T1053, labeled \"Scheduled Task/Job\", is a categorization of methods that adversaries use to execute malicious code by scheduling tasks or jobs on a system. This technique is widely utilized for persistence, privilege escalation, and the remote execution of tasks. The technique is applicable across various environments and platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.\\\nThe technique consists of multiple sub-techniques, each highlighting a distinct mechanism for scheduling tasks or jobs. These sub-techniques include T1053.001 (Scheduled Task), T1053.002 (At for Windows), T1053.003 (Cron), T1053.004 (Launchd), T1053.005 (At for Linux), and T1053.006 (Systemd Timers).\\\nScheduled Task (T1053.001) focuses on adversaries' methods for scheduling tasks on a Windows system to maintain persistence or escalate privileges. These tasks can be set to execute at specified times, in response to particular events, or after a defined time interval.\\\nThe At command for Windows (T1053.002) enables administrators to schedule tasks on a Windows system. Adversaries may exploit this command to execute programs at system startup or at a predetermined schedule for persistence.\\\nCron (T1053.003) is a built-in job scheduler found in Unix-like operating systems. Adversaries can use cron jobs to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.\\\nLaunchd (T1053.004) is a service management framework present in macOS. Adversaries may utilize launchd to maintain persistence on macOS systems by setting up daemons or agents to execute at specific times or in response to defined events.\\\nThe At command for Linux (T1053.005) enables administrators to schedule tasks on a Linux system. Adversaries can use this command to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.\\\nSystemd Timers (T1053.006) offer a means of scheduling tasks on Linux systems using systemd. Adversaries can use systemd timers to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.\\\nDetection and mitigation strategies vary for each sub-technique. For instance, monitoring the creation of scheduled tasks or looking for uncorrelated changes to tasks that do not align with known software or patch cycles can be effective for detecting malicious activity related to this technique. Mitigation strategies may involve restricting permissions and applying application control solutions to prevent adversaries from scheduling tasks.", "references": ["https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/"], "tags": {"name": "Scheduled Tasks", "analytic_story": "Scheduled Tasks", "category": ["Adversary Tactics"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_enrichments": [], "mitre_attack_tactics": [], "datamodels": [], "kill_chain_phases": []}, "detection_names": [], "investigation_names": [], "baseline_names": [], "author_company": "Splunk", "author_name": "Michael Haag", "detections": []}, {"name": "Signed Binary Proxy Execution InstallUtil", "author": "Michael Haag, Splunk", "date": "2021-11-12", "version": 1, "id": "9482a314-43dc-11ec-a3c9-acde48001122", "description": "Adversaries may use InstallUtil to proxy execution of code through a trusted Windows utility.", "narrative": "InstallUtil is a command-line utility that allows for installation and uninstallation of resources by executing specific installer components specified in .NET binaries.

Many systems in this P2P network serve as relay nodes which route disguised operational traffic to and from Snake implants on the FSB's ultimate targets. Snake's custom communications protocols employ encryption and fragmentation for confidentiality and are designed to hamper detection and collection efforts. We consider Snake to be the most sophisticated cyber espionage tool in the FSB's arsenal. The sophistication of Snake stems from three principal areas. First, Snake employs means to achieve a rare level of stealth in its host components and network communications. Second, Snake's internal technical architecture allows for easy incorporation of new or replacement components. This design also facilitates the development and interoperability of Snake instances running on different host operating systems. We have observed interoperable Snake implants for Windows, MacOS, and Linux operating systems. Lastly, Snake demonstrates careful software engineering design and implementation, with the implant containing surprisingly few bugs given its complexity.

This vulnerability affects the StringSubstitutor interpolator class, which is included in the Commons Text library. A default interpolator allows for string lookups that can lead to Remote Code Execution. This is due to a logic flaw that makes the \"script,\" \"dns,\" and \"url\" lookup keys interpolated by default, as opposed to what it should be, according to the documentation of the StringLookupFactory class. Those keys allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code via lookups. In order to exploit the vulnerabilities, the following requirements must be met - Run a version of Apache Commons Text from version 1.5 to 1.9 and use the StringSubstitutor interpolator. It is important to specify that the StringSubstitutor interpolator is not as widely used as the string substitution in Log4j, which led to Log4Shell. According to the CVSSv3 system, it scores 9.8 as CRITICAL severity. The severity is Critical due to the easy exploitability and huge potential impact in terms of confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

Bootkits reside at a layer below the operating system and may make it difficult to perform full remediation unless an organization suspects one was used and can act accordingly.", "narrative": "A bootkit is a sophisticated type of malware that targets the boot sectors of a hard drive, specifically the Master Boot Record (MBR) and Volume Boot Record (VBR). The MBR is the initial section of the disk that is loaded following the hardware initialization process executed by the Basic Input/Output System (BIOS). It houses the boot loader, which is responsible for loading the operating system. In contrast, the VBR is located at the beginning of each partition and contains the boot code for that specific partition. When an adversary gains raw access to the boot drive, they can overwrite the MBR or VBR, effectively diverting the execution during startup from the standard boot loader to the malicious code injected by the attacker. This tampering allows the malware to load before the operating system, enabling it to execute malicious activities stealthily and maintain persistence on the compromised system. Bootkits are particularly dangerous because they can bypass security measures implemented by the operating system and antivirus software. Since they load before the operating system, they can easily evade detection and manipulate the system's behavior from the earliest stages of the boot process. This capability makes bootkits a potent tool in an attacker's arsenal for gaining unauthorized access, stealing sensitive information, or launching further attacks on other systems. To defend against bootkit attacks, organizations should implement multiple layers of security, including strong endpoint protection, regular software updates, user awareness training, and monitoring for unusual system behavior.

Multiple binaries were dropped onto the system via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), some of which were flagged as potential exploits for a known vulnerability. However, a string containing the Russian term for \"0day\" suggested an unknown vulnerability was at play. Subsequent investigations identified this as a zero-day vulnerability affecting the Windows Error Reporting (WER) component, now known as CVE-2023-36874. \\\nThe WER service's function is to report software issues on Windows hosts. The exploit centered around manipulating the WER service by redirecting file systems to execute attacker-controlled code with elevated privileges. This was achieved by creating a symbolic link redirection from the C:\\ drive to an attacker-controlled directory, and then triggering certain WER functions. Consequently, an unauthorized executable was run instead of the legitimate one, giving the attacker high-level access. \\\nThe observed exploit kit's primary objective was to initiate a privileged interpreter, such as cmd.exe or powershell_ise.exe. If this couldn't be achieved, a privileged scheduled task was created as an alternative. The exploit kit showcased a range of binaries, some packed and others not, some in C++ and others in pure C. This diversity suggests the knowledge of the vulnerability was likely shared among different developers. \\\nCrowdStrike's Counter Adversary Operations, as of now, hasn't linked this activity to any specific threat actor.

Some of the malicious behaviors involved may include inserting spaces before file extensions or prepending the file extension with a different one, among other techniques.", "narrative": "Attackers use a variety of techniques to entice users to run malicious code or to persist on an endpoint. One way to accomplish these goals is to leverage file extensions and the mechanism Windows uses to associate files with specific applications. \\\n Since its earliest days, Windows has used extensions to identify file types. Users have become familiar with these extensions and their application associations. For example, if users see that a file ends in `.doc` or `.docx`, they will assume that it is a Microsoft Word document and expect that double-clicking will open it using `winword.exe`. The user will typically also presume that the `.docx` file is safe. \\\n Attackers take advantage of this expectation by obfuscating the true file extension. They can accomplish this in a couple of ways. One technique involves inserting multiple spaces in the file name before the extension to hide the extension from the GUI, obscuring the true nature of the file. Another approach involves prepending the real extension with a different one. This is especially effective when Windows is configured to \"hide extensions for known file types.\" In this case, the real extension is not displayed, but the prepended one is, leading end users to believe the file is a different type than it actually is.\\\nChanging the association between a file extension and an application can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. The technique typically involves changing the association for an often-launched file type to associate instead with a malicious program the attacker has dropped on the endpoint. When the end user launches a file that has been manipulated in this way, it will execute the attacker's malware. It will also execute the application the end user expected to run, cleverly obscuring the fact that something suspicious has occurred.\\\nRun the searches in this story to detect and investigate suspicious behavior that may indicate abuse or manipulation of Windows file extensions and/or associations.", "references": ["https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2013/12/file-extensions-2/", "https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1042"], "tags": {"name": "Windows File Extension and Association Abuse", "analytic_story": "Windows File Extension and Association Abuse", "category": ["Malware"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_enrichments": [], "mitre_attack_tactics": [], "datamodels": [], "kill_chain_phases": []}, "detection_names": [], "investigation_names": ["ESCU - Get Notable History - Response Task", "ESCU - Get Parent Process Info - Response Task", "ESCU - Get Process Info - Response Task"], "baseline_names": [], "author_company": "Splunk", "author_name": "Rico Valdez", "detections": []}, {"name": "Windows Log Manipulation", "author": "Rico Valdez, Splunk", "date": "2017-09-12", "version": 2, "id": "b6db2c60-a281-48b4-95f1-2cd99ed56835", "description": "Adversaries often try to cover their tracks by manipulating Windows logs.

The two critical vulnerabilities are CVE-2023-40044, a .NET deserialization flaw, and CVE-2023-42657, a directory traversal vulnerability. Rapid7 has observed active exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Affected versions are prior to 8.7.4 and 8.8.2. Immediate action is advised - upgrade to WS_FTP Server version 8.8.2. For those unable to update, disabling the Ad Hoc Transfer module is suggested as a temporary measure. This comes in the wake of increased scrutiny following the Cl0p ransomware attack on MOVEit Transfer in May 2023.", "narrative": "Two critical vulnerabilities have been identified in WS_FTP Server, a widely-used secure file transfer solution. The first, CVE-2023-40044, is a .NET deserialization flaw that targets the Ad Hoc Transfer module of WS_FTP Server versions earlier than 8.7.4 and 8.8.2. This flaw allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server's operating system without needing authentication. The second vulnerability, CVE-2023-42657, is a directory traversal flaw that allows attackers to perform unauthorized file operations outside of their authorized WS_FTP folder. In severe cases, the attacker could escape the WS_FTP Server file structure and perform operations on the underlying operating system. Both vulnerabilities have been observed being exploited in the wild and immediate action for mitigation is strongly advised. Updating to WS_FTP Server version 8.8.2 is recommended. For those unable to update, disabling the Ad Hoc Transfer module is suggested as a temporary measure.", "references": ["https://www.assetnote.io/resources/research/rce-in-progress-ws-ftp-ad-hoc-via-iis-http-modules-cve-2023-40044", "https://community.progress.com/s/article/WS-FTP-Server-Critical-Vulnerability-September-2023", "https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-40044", "https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2023/09/29/etr-critical-vulnerabilities-in-ws_ftp-server/", "https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/security/fantastic-iis-modules-and-how-to-find-them.html"], "tags": {"name": "WS FTP Server Critical Vulnerabilities", "analytic_story": "WS FTP Server Critical Vulnerabilities", "category": ["Adversary Tactics"], "product": ["Splunk Enterprise", "Splunk Enterprise Security", "Splunk Cloud"], "usecase": "Advanced Threat Detection", "mitre_attack_enrichments": [], "mitre_attack_tactics": [], "datamodels": [], "kill_chain_phases": []}, "detection_names": [], "investigation_names": [], "baseline_names": [], "author_company": "Splunk", "author_name": "Michael Haag", "detections": []}, {"name": "XMRig", "author": "Teoderick Contreras, Rod Soto Splunk", "date": "2021-05-07", "version": 1, "id": "06723e6a-6bd8-4817-ace2-5fb8a7b06628", "description": "Leverage searches that allow you to detect and investigate unusual activities that might relate to the xmrig monero, including looking for file writes associated with its payload, process command-line, defense evasion (killing services, deleting users, modifying files or folder permission, killing other malware or other coin miner) and hacking tools including Telegram as mean of Command And Control (C2) to download other files.
